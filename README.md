I'm a feature film director and white belt developer. I plan to build an NFT for the "The Yoga Sutra - Zorie Barber Film" that uses filecoin to store the video file.    Film Synopsis: A perilous journey into the heart of America. Friday, recently fired from her dead end corporate job, is on a vision quest. When her motorcycle breaks down on the Arizona Mexico border, the local sheriff detains her on trumped up charges and finds a strange book in her backpack. Thinking she has crossed the border illegally and that the handwritten book is terrorist gang code, the sheriff locks her up in his backwater jail indefinitely. Can Friday use her mastery of ancient wisdom to overcome an increasingly desperate situation?
